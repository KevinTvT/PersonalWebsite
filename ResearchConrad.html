							<p>This fall, I joined a medical research project mentored by Professor Rajapakase from University of Pennsylvania. The project is about researching sports-related injuries from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. My goal is to lead the team to build and train an AI model that can automate diagnosis and improve diagnostic accuracy. This would give hospitals enough time to prepare before a patient's arrival and would shorten urgent patientsâ€™ wait time before surgery.</p>

							<p style="font-size:small; text-align:center">3D model prototype of the splint, this is an inflated version and the indent along the back represents a splint</p>
							<p> Through my sports-injury research, I observed that common injuries are sprained wrists and ankles. I used engineering techniques to design an inflatable splint that will form a cold compression layer to secure the injured area.  With support from Professor Rajapakase, I am working with my team on submitting this innovation to the Conrad Challenge, an international innovation and entrepreneurship competition. </p>
							<h2 style="text-align:center"> The Design of the splint</h2>
							<p> Our innovation is an ankle splint that is inflated and cooled by chemical reactions. It has a back zipper to easily slip the foot inside the splint, and an outer inflatable layer. Inside, next to the ankle joining and limb is a thinner layer filled with the components for our chemical reaction to inflate the splint. This thinner layer will also have many tiny holes in order for gas to escape and then inflate the splint while the liquid is contained. This product is unique because it combines the functions of both traditional splints and ice packs. Additionally, we used the chemical reaction between sodium bicarbonate and citric acid to create carbon dioxide to inflate the splint. The chemicals will be stored in separate compartments in the inner layer and can be mixed together by breaking the compartment boundary when the splint needs to be applied. This compartment boundary is made of a flimsy plastic with weak points at the edge. Thus, when the water compartment is squeezed, a pressure increase will break through the barrier and water will rush into the chemical compartment and start the chemical reaction.</p>
							<h2 style="text-align:center">My job in the project</h2>
							<p>My job within the project consisted on working on the design of the splint with the other team members and figuring out how the splint would be activated, what the design would be, and other technical aspects. Additionally, I participated in the development of the team's business model: what our expenses would be, how much to sell each product unit. Finally, my biggest contribution to the project is the 3D model and the website. As the sole team member with solid experience in both of those field, I used CAD to design the 3D model and fully designed and deployed the website for the project. </p>
